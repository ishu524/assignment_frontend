# Runner Image Setup - IMPORTANT

## Quick Setup:

You have the runner image shown in your design screenshot. Here's how to add it:

### Option 1: Use Your Image (Recommended)
1. Save the runner image from your design as `runner.jpg`
2. Copy/paste the image file into: `asignment_project/public/runner.jpg`
3. The app will automatically display it

### Option 2: Use a Temporary Placeholder
The code includes a fallback gradient that will show if the image is missing.

### Option 3: Use a Free Stock Image (Temporary)
You can use this free runner image temporarily:
- Go to: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/runner-silhouette-sunset

## File Location:
```
asignment_project/
  └── public/
      └── runner.jpg  ← Place your image here
```

## After Adding Image:
1. Save the image in the public folder
2. If the dev server is running, it will auto-refresh
